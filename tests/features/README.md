# Product specification

## Intro

Even though we cannot use Cucumber or other Behavior-Driven Development framework, we believe that describing Carbonable features with Gherkin syntax can provide value.

For example, it will enable product owners and non tech people to understand and have a clear view of the business rules for each feature of the product.

## Gherkin

- [Gherkin reference](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/)

## Process

The idea is to write `.feature` files in `tests/features` directory and use those files as the source of truth for the specification of the product features.

> Note: The files wont be automatically processed. They are just a reference for anyone to understand exactly how the features of the product work.
